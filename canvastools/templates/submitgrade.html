                <h3>Submit Grades To SSOL</h3>
                <p>The Student Services OnLine (SSOL) system can import grades from CourseWorks. To transfer your course grades that are recorded in CourseWorks to SSOL for final submission, follow these steps:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Click the “Submit Grades To SSOL” button below,</li>
                    <li>Log in to SSOL,</li>
                    <li>Click the “Upload Grades” button,</li>
                    <li>Click the “Upload from CourseWorks” option,</li>
                    <li> If SSOL displays an error message indicating that a grade cannot be assigned to a student, correct the grade and overwrite,</li>
                    <li> Save, review and (when you are sure the grades are accurate) submit them to SSOL.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Please Note: “draft” versions of final grades can be uploaded and saved in SSOL from CourseWorks as many times as you wish. However, you may only submit final grades via SSOL once. For subsequent changes after final submission, contact the registrar’s office (at ssol@wjchen.org). If you have questions about CourseWorks’ Gradebook function contact newcourseworks@wjchen.org.</p>
